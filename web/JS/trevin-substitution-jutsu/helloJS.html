        What is a scripting languagee?
            a scripting language is a snippet of "code" that automates some
            functionality. A script is NOT a complete application/program, it's just a snippet of code.

        What ......in the blue blazes....is JavaScript?
            It's a programming/scripting language originally designed to provide functionality
            to web pages; effectively making those webpages dynamic. It allows website clients
            to run code from THEIR machines instead of always returning to a server for new
            information/calculations

        JavaScript is interpreted by the browser. Google Chrome uses the v8 JS-engine. 
            Firefoxe uses the SpiderMonkey JS-engine.
        LATER, due to JavaScripts populatiry, someone ripped out Chrome's v8 engine and
            wrapped it in a c++ program and so it can run on a server...they did this so they can
            use JS in places other than a browser.
        What is the name of the disembodied v8 engine wrapped in a c++ shell?
            NodeJS.
        
        So nowadays JS can be used to create entire fullstack applications.

        Features of JS:
            -Support Functional Programming
            -Object Oriented
            -Loosely Typed
                (a variable can hold ANY datatype)
            -It's a dynamic language
                (you can easily control JS during runtime)
                    >more details: you can modify the structure of objects FAR MORE
                     while the program is running tha in a non-dynamic language
            -It has a JIT compiler (Just In Time)
                    >js is not compiled, it's interpreted
            -originally built for DOM manipulation, bit it has evoled
                >DOM = Document Object Model
                >the DOM is a virtual representation of an HTML page
            -generally, intrerpreted by the browser or node.js
