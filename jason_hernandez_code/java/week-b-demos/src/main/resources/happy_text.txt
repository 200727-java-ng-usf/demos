Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. You're meant to have fun in life.

Use your imagination, let it go. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.
