Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.
There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them
in your mind first. Look at them little rascals. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you
happy then it's good.
