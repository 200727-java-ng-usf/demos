					Here are the lyrics to the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air<br>
				</strong>
			</header>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Now this is a story all about how<br>
			My life got flipped turned upside down<br>
			And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there<br>
			I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air<br>
			</article><article>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			In West Philadelphia born and raised<br>
			On the playground is where I spent most of my days<br>
			Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool<br>
			And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school<br>
			When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br>
			Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br>
			I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
			And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"<br>
			I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br>
			But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way<br>
			She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket<br>
			I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"<br>
			First class, yo, this is bad<br>
			Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass<br>
			Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?<br>
			Hmm, this might be all right<br>
			But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that<br>
			Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?<br>
			I don't think so, I'll see when I get there<br>
			I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air<br>
			</article><article>
			[Verse 3]<br>
			Well, uh<br>
			The plane landed and when I came out<br>
			There was a dude, looked like a cop, standing there with my name out<br>
			I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here<br>
			I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared<br>
			I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br>
			The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror<br>
			If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br>
			But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, Holmes, to Bel-Air!"<br>
			</article><article>
			[Verse 4]<br>
			I pulled<br>
			Up to a house about seven or eight<br>
			And I yelled to the cabbie "Yo', Holmes, smell ya later"<br>
			Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there<br>
			To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air<br>
