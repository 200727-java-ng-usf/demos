<!-- This is going to add functionality to web pages

JavaScript is a scripting language
What is a scripting language
	- a scripting language iis a snippet of "code" that 
	automates some functionality. A script is NOT a 
	complete application/program, it's just a snippet of 
	code.
What ..............in the blue blazes........is JavaScript?
	It's a programming/scripting language originally designed to provide
	functionality to web pages; effectively making those webpages dynamic.
	It allows website clients to run code from THEIR machines instead of 
	always returning to a server for new information/calculations

Javascript is interpreted by the browser. Google Chrome uses the v8 JS-engine.
	Firefox uses the SpiderMonkey JS-engine. 
LATER, due to JavaScript's popularity, someone ripped out Chrome's v8 engine 
	and wrapped it ina c++ program so it can run on a server... they did this 
	so they can use JS in places other than a browser.
What is the name of the disembodied v8 engine wrapped in a c++ shell?
	NodeJS.

So nowadays JS can be used to create entire fullstack applications.

Features of JS:
	-Support Functional Programming 
	-Object Oriented
	-Loosely Typed
		(a variable can hold any data type)
	-Dynamic Language (ease of control)
		(you can fully control JS during runtime)
			> more details: you can modify the structure of the objects FAR MORE
				while the program is running than in non;-dynamic language
	-It has a JIT compiler (Just In Time)
		>js is not compiled, it's interpreted.
	-Originally built for DOM manipulation, but it has evolved
		>DOM = Document Object Model
		>the DOM is a virtual representation of an HTML page
	-generally, interpreted by the browser or node.js
