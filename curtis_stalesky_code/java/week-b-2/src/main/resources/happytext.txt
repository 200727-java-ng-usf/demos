This is the fun part I thought today we would do a happy little picture.
And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening -
you just let it happen. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.

Let's do that again. It is a lot of fun. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.
If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Let's have a little bit
of fun today. I get carried away with this brush cleaning.

We'll put a happy little bush here. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. I'll go over
the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown,
Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.

We'll put a happy little sky in here. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world.
It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.

We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him
reflections. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. It looks so good, I might as
well not stop.

Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Use what you see, don't plan it. A tree cannot be straight
if it has a crooked trunk.

All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out
here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.
I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.
Every day I learn. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the
contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives
right in here.
