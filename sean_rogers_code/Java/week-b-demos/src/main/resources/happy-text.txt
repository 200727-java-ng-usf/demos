And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Just beat the devil out of it. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.

This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. It takes dark in order to show light. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.

We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Don't fight it, use what happens. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Take your time. Speed will come later.
